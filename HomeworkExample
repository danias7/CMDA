# In[1]: Import packages

import matplotlib as mp
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import xlrd
import datetime
import scipy


# In[2]: Read project data from excel into pandas
mlbdata = pd.read_csv('/Users/Dani/Documents/CMDA/Python/Homework2-Baseballdata.csv')

# In[3]: Display project data array
mlbdata.values

# In[4]: Default for the number of rows within the data set starting at 0. (number of rows=50)
mlbdata.index

# In[4]: Fill any missing values with "NULL"
missingval=pd.read_csv('/Users/Dani/Documents/CMDA/Python/Homework2-Baseballdata.csv',na_values=['NULL'])
missingval
# No missing values found


# In[6]:Displays multiple summary statistics for the project data including mean, standard deviation, max, min, quartiles, and count according to each numerical category
mlbdata.describe()

# In[7]:Plot that graphs the frequency of Team name within the roster and produces a bar chart
mb=pd.value_counts(mlbdata.Team, sort=False).plot(kind='barh')


# In[8]: First visulization created from project data. Shows the amount of times each player has played a game

fig1=pd.value_counts(mlbdata.G, sort=False).plot(kind='bar')
label1=fig1.set_title('Frequency of Number of Games Played by Each Player')
xaxis1=fig1.set_xlabel('Amount of Games Played')
yaxis1=fig1.set_ylabel('Number of Players')


# In[9]: Second visulization that shows how many players are on each team from the given roster
fig2=pd.value_counts(mlbdata.Team, sort=False).plot(kind='barh')
label2=fig2.set_title('Frequency of Teams represented by Players')
xaxis2=fig2.set_xlabel('Amount Players on Team')
yaxis2=fig2.set_ylabel('Team City Abbreviations')


# In[10]: Third visulization that maps the rank of the player to the number of bases stolen
fig3=plt.scatter(mlbdata['RK'],mlbdata['SB'])
label3=plt.title('Scatterplot of Player Rank v. Number of Bases Stolen')
ticks3=plt.xticks(range(50))
ticks3y=plt.yticks([0,5,10,15,20,25,30])
xaxis3=plt.xlabel('Rank of Player')
yaxis3=plt.ylabel('Amount of Bases Stolen')


# In[11]: Pickle created for the data
mlbdata.to_pickle('mlbdata_pickle')


# In[12]: Check to ensure that the pickle was created
pd.read_pickle('mlbdata_pickle')
